# Student-Dashboard-x

This project has been created with Vite + React
Vite builds way faster and is more comfortable to work with in my opinion.

Type `npm run dev` to load the app localy

In this project i applied all the requirements including the bonusses.

## Used Libraries/tools

- React
- Redux
- React Router 6.4+
- Recharts (for the charts)
- Faker Api (fake data)
- PapaParse (for parsing CSV's)
- SCSS

There is no local CSV file. It's an online excel sheet that autmatically publish changes.
